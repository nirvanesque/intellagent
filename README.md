**Chat-Agent-Simulator (CHAS)** is an AI-powered diagnostic framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. It simulates thousands of edge-case scenarios to comprehensively evaluate chatbot agents. By stress-testing your agent from all angles in wide-range of complexity levels, CHAS helps identify potential failure points and provides detailed performance analysis to ensure reliable deployment.

Don't limit your chatbot's potential because of what you don't know. Use CHAS to know exactly what your agent can handle, fix what it can't, and deploy with confidence.

## Key Features


- üî¨ Simulates thousands of **realistic** edge-case events tailored to your chatbot agent and system data schema
- ü§ñ Simulates user interactions with your agent based on generated events
- üìä Comprehensive report with evaluation metrics including success rates, policy & tools failure points, complexity-level analysis
- üí™ Enables confident deployment of more reliable chatbot agents

## :fire: Quickstart

> For a more detailed and comprehensive guide, see the [Quickstart Guide](TODO add reference).









Chat-Agent-Simulator (CHAS) requires `python == 3.10`
<br />

#### Step 1 - Download and install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:plurai-ai/Chat-Agent-Simulator.git
cd Chat-Agent-Simulator
```

You can use Conda, pip, or pipenv to install the dependencies.

Using pip: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Step 2 - Set your LLM API Key

Edit the `config/llm_env.yml` file to set up your LLM configuration:

```yaml
openai:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
```

####  Step 3 - Run the Simulator
If you're utilizing Azure OpenAI services for `user_llm`, ensure you [disable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters) the default `jailbreak` filter before running the simulator.

For fast simple environment without database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/education --config_path ./config/config_education.yml 
```
For more complex environment with database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/airline --config_path ./config/config_airline.yml 
```

Explore the [Customization](TODO add reference) options to configure the simulation for your environment, or delve into the [examples](TODO add reference) we provide to learn more about its capabilities.
#### Step 4 - See the Results

To visualize the simulation results using streamlit, run:
```bash 
streamlit run simulator/visualization/Simulator_Visualizer.py
```
This will launch a[ Streamlit dashboard](./README.md#-demo) showing detailed analytics and visualizations of your simulation results.
